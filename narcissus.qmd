title: "Narcissus Looks Back"
---

## Introduction

In Ovid's _Metamorphoses_, a young hunter named Narcissus falls into love with his own reflection in a pool of water. He stares at the pool in longing until he dies, and then his body disappears and becomes a flower.

Not knowing what he sees, he adores the sight;  
That false face fools and fuels his delight.  
You simple boy, why strive in vain to catch  
A fleeting image? What you see is nowhere;  
And what you love---but turn away---you love!

I thought about calling it a "final report" or something equally transparent.


## What I Wanted

Let's look at the project summary once more:

> The animint2 Documentation and Bug Fix Project will make the animint2 reference documentation more accessible, fix errors in the documentation, and reduce the number of bugs by at least one.

This was a bit ambitious.
