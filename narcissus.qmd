title: "Narcissus Looks Back"
---

## Introduction

> Not knowing what he sees, he adores the sight;  
> That false face fools and fuels his delight.  
> You simple boy, why strive in vain to catch  
> A fleeting image? What you see is nowhere;  
> And what you love---but turn away---you lose!

In Ovid's _Metamorphoses_, a young hunter named Narcissus sees his reflection in a pool of water and falls in love with it. He can't look away. He stares at the pool in longing till he withers away and dies and becomes a flower.^[Ovid. _Metamorphoses_. Translated by A. D. Melville. 1986.]

From Narcissus we get "narcissism," which is generally used to refer to excessive self-centeredness or selfishness. Narcissus seems an appropriate mascot for this essay. For this is an essay specifically about what _I've_ done over GSOC 2023.

Don't misunderstand. I love navel-gazing. I usually don't do it in public, but it's part of GSOC's [work product submission requirement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/work-product), so here we are. Enjoy.


## What I Did

My principal contribution was the construction of the [animint2 website](https://animint.github.io/animint2/).^[See the [pull request here](https://github.com/animint/animint2/pull/105).] I'm pretty proud of it. I wrote a [quick start guide](https://animint.github.io/animint2/articles/animint2.html) to introduce people to `animint2`, [organized and summarized `animint2`'s many functions](https://animint.github.io/animint2/reference/index.html), re-wrote the [README](https://animint.github.io/animint2/index.html), and made other little changes to make the website comfortable and usable.

Making the website was exhausting in parts, but broadly it was a satisfying experience. I love making websites. I love HTML and CSS---though I actually wrote very little HTML during this time, since the website was generated with `pkgdown`. Most of the HTML I wrote can be found in the quick start guide, intertwined with the Markdown that composes much of the document. This was an unfortunate necessity.^["Unfortunate," because it makes `vignettes/animint2.Rmd` a bit of an aesthetic mess.] By themselves, Markdown and `pkgdown` just don't have the power to do what I need.

and makes . Oh, well. The `pkgdown/extra.css` file fared



Many of the codeblocks in the quick start guide contain code annotations. Toby said that I should implement them. 


## What I Wanted

Let's look at the project summary once more:

> The animint2 Documentation and Bug Fix Project will make the animint2 reference documentation more accessible, fix errors in the documentation, and reduce the number of bugs by at least one.

This was a bit ambitious.
