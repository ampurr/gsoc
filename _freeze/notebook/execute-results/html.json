The [answer is no](https://community.rstudio.com/t/how-to-run-quarto-qmd-from-within-package/154711/2).\n  + Looked up why `pkgdown` [adds the `docs/` directory into `.gitignore`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69507610/unable-to-push-package-website-pkgdown-from-r-to-github). But it's still unclear to me.\n  + Noticed that the intro to `pkgdown` page [accidentally uses the word \"setting\" twice in a row](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/pkgdown.html).\n- Learned more about git:\n  + Learned of `gitk`, which I've never used before.\n  + Learned about [managing my git credentials in `usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html).\n- Looked up some tips on how to write code comments better. Tips from: [Antonin Januska](https://web.archive.org/web/20201111223912/https://antjanus.com/blog/web-design-tips/best-comment-separator/) and [Ellen Spertus](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/12/23/best-practices-for-writing-code-comments/).\n- Learned that the string `GITHUB_PAT` can be found in the `.github/workflows` directory.\n- Learned about documentation managers. There's: [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/) and [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/).\n- Learned that there are, like, eight test suites. And they automatically run when you make a pull request to the `animint2` repository. That's nice. I'm also learning that the tests take a long time to run---about 45 minutes.\n- Turns out that `ripgrep-all` doesn't look through YAML files. I need something like `yq` instead. Why?\n\n### Created\n\n- Created `README.md` from the `README.org` file via the magic of `pandoc`.\n- Created a preliminary website and documented how I generated it:\n  + For the documentation and code, see `website_setup.Rmd`. Currently have information about building the website.\n  + Put the site up online.\n- Accidentally made a pull request in `tdhock/animint2`. Should've been `ampurr/animint2` instead. I closed it---be more careful.\n- Made a pull request in `ampurr/animint2` but did not initially succeed in closing it due to a test failing. Later, I pushed it anyway, which then threw the website online.\n- Successfully set up the website. But there are some errors. Most noticeably: it includes some functions that don't seem to be part of `animint2`. Will need to investigate further.\n\n### Confused\n\nOne of the tests---\"Test Suite compiler\"---failed. Here's the error message:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n══ Failed tests ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n── Error ('test-compiler-gist.R:4:3'): animint2gist() returns an object of class 'gist' ──\nError: Error: In non-interactive environments, please set GITHUB_PAT env to a GitHub access token (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use)\nBacktrace:\n    ▆\n 1. └─animint2::animint2gist(list(p = qplot(1:10)), browse = FALSE) at test-compiler-gist.R:4:2\n 2.   └─gistr::gist_create(...)\n 3.     ├─gistr:::gist_POST(...)\n 4.     │ └─gistr:::cVERB(...)\n 5.     │   └─crul::HttpClient$new(url, headers = c(auth, headers), opts = list(...))\n 6.     │     └─crul (local) initialize(...)\n 7.     └─gistr::gist_auth()\n\n[ FAIL 1 | WARN 0 | SKIP 5 | PASS 756 ]\nError: Error: Test failures\nExecution halted\nError: Process completed with exit code 1.\n```\n:::\n\nThis is confusing, since I thought `GITHUB_PAT` was already set with a GitHub Access Token. I was also unaware of the large array of tests that activate when you try to push something. Quite frankly, I'm not sure what they do or what they prevent. It feels different than using `testthat`.\n\nI also don't understand the GitHub workflow stuff. What exactly is GitHub doing?\n\n\n## Week 2\n\nThis week (June 5 to June 11), I tried to fix [issue 89](https://github.com/tdhock/animint2/issues/89). I did not succeed.\n\n### Learned\n\n- Learned that the [`roxygen2` package](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) generates both the `.Rd` files and part of the `DESCRIPTION` for packages.\n- Learned that [`devtools` AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/r-devtools) has so so so many dependencies.\n- This is real basic, but I re-learned that `bash foo.sh` runs shell scripts. I haven't run one since September of 2022.\n- Looked into _Writing R Extensions_, which I was not previously aware existed:\n  + Read the [DESCRIPTION file](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file) portion.\n  + Learned about [RFC 2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822), a syntax standard for text messages in email. FastMail mentions that [RFC 5322 makes RFC 2822 obsolete](https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/1500000278382-Email-standards), but _Writing_ requests emails be written in RFC 2822 formatting.\n- When using Git Bash---i.e. [MinGW](https://mingw.osdn.io/)---and `cd`, I need to swap the backwards slashes for forward slashes. Oddly, the backwards slashes work for some directories but not for others. It took me a while to realize this while debugging.\n- Figured out that the `borders()` function is part of `fortify-map.r`. That's why it disappeared when I deleted that R file.\n- Learning about bash.\n- Learned that all the tidyverse data tidiers will eventually be retired. This includes both `ggplot2::fortify()` and `broom::tidy()`.\n\n### Created\n\nNothing of value. I created several branches to try and fix the issue and didn't succeed.\n\n- [One branch](https://github.com/tdhock/animint2/tree/89-sp-maptools-dependency) focused on removing the `fortify` functions in `animint2`. This caused several tests to fail. Later, [Toby told me](https://github.com/tdhock/animint2/pull/93#issuecomment-1585976690) that `map_data` is used in several tests and relies on the `fortify` functions.\n- As part of a debugging process, [one branch was a copy of the main branch](https://github.com/tdhock/animint2/tree/89-bug-exam-slightly-altered-main-branch) with an additional text document. It was meant to test the GitHub tests. It passed the tests.\n- Another branch was meant to debug the branch where I removed the `fortify` functions.\n\n### Failed\n\nMy debugging process didn't succeed. Or, at the very least, it didn't succeed in time.\n\nParts of it were headed in the right direction. After some experimentation, I confirmed that the problem stemmed from my changes to the repository (the removal of the `fortify` functions) and not from either `build.sh` or the GitHub tests. But my debugging was focused on the following error message:\n\n> Error in `FUN(X[[i]], ...)`: numeric 'envir' arg not of length one.\n\nThis error message comes from the `ggplot2` side of `animint2`'s code. In some sense, I was looking in the right direction---the `fortify` functions are from the `ggplot2` side of things. But I was focused on figuring out substitutes for `fortify` and failed to notice that the problem was with `map_data`.\n\n### Confused\n\nFor some reason, `build.sh` always fails to generate the $\\LaTeX$ document correctly, mentioning some problem with the `.Rd` files. Then I think it runs the process again, and the problem disappears. Why?\n\nWhy are the tidyverse data tidiers being retired? I can't find any info about that.\n\n`yay -S r-plyr r-reshape2` isn't working and requires \"manual intervention.\" Why? Luckily, this isn't important---`build.sh` runs perfectly fine on Git Bash and therefore I don't actually need to figure out why the `yay` helper is acting this way.\n\n\n## Week 3\n\nThis week (June 12 to June 18), I complained a lot. I chatted with Fei, who said that she would take care of [issue 90](https://github.com/tdhock/animint2/issues/90). Thank you, Fei!\n\n### Learned\n\n- First meeting with Toby!\n  + `animint2` doesn't compute---all computations are done beforehand, and then `animint2` displays that as an interactive data visualization.\n  + Also learned that capital letters go before lowercase letters in terms of alphabetical order. At least according to R.\n  + `build.sh`, and some of the GitHub Actions, are meant to emulate CRAN checks.\n  + All else being equal, prefer small changes over large changes.\n- Looked up [selenium documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/) in order to figure out if a test case for [issue 90](https://github.com/tdhock/animint2/issues/90) was possible.\n- Preliminary research on alt-text for `ggplot2`, graphs, and data visualizations:\n  + N. Elmqvist. [Data Visualization for the Blind](https://doi.org/10.1145/3571737). In _Interactions_. 2023.\n  + Office for National Statistics. [Alt Text: A Guide to Writing About Statistics](https://style.ons.gov.uk/accessibility/alt-text/).\n  + C. Jung and others. [Communicating Visualizations without Visuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03657). In _ArXiv_. 2021.\n- Learned about `rtools`, which is necessary to make R packages in Windows:\n  + Learned that `rtools` is not an R package, but [must be installed separately](https://community.rstudio.com/t/errors-in-rtool-installations-install-packages-rtool-package-rtool-is-not-available/35689).\n  + Found some [`rtools` documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/index.html).\n  + Toby sent a link that mentioned `rtools` [needs MikTeX and Inconsolata](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-4.3.html).\n- Discovered the [`rmini` package](https://github.com/yihui/rmini/), which I've been using for testing purposes.\n- The _R Packages_ book has [an appendix about `R CMD` checks](https://r-pkgs.org/R-CMD-check.html#documentation), including bug fix suggestions for $\\LaTeX$ errors.\n- Took a look at [Chapter 12: Packages](https://www.uvm.edu/~tdonovan/RforFledglings/packages.html) in _R for Fledglings_, but it wasn't helpful.\n- There's a Stack Overflow question about [$\\LaTeX$ errors in R packages](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10819959/diagnosing-r-package-build-warning-latex-errors-when-creating-pdf-version).\n\n### Created\n\n- Made a comment in [issue 90](https://github.com/tdhock/animint2/issues/90). Fei fixed Big Bug, but Little Bug is left.\n- Made a new issue: [issue 96](https://github.com/tdhock/animint2/issues/96), which is about some $\\LaTeX$ errors that seem exclusive to me.\n\n\n## Week 4\n\nThis week (June 19 to June 25), I tried to set up the reference website again---this time in Toby's repository instead of my fork. This didn't work, so I started tinkering with my fork again.\n\n### Learned\n\n- [Here are the GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Look here when you have a question about GitHub.\n- Looked up how to get permission to change GitHub Page settings in the `animint2` repository. One [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40673052/how-to-promote-a-collaborator-to-have-owner-rights) suggested obtaining admin rights. Instead, Toby created an organization for repository and gave us permissions that way.\n- Looked up info about the [GitHub Pages API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pages).\n- Refamiliarized myself with aspects of git that I've never used before:\n  + On detached HEADs: [Stack Overflow: How Do I Fix a Detached HEAD?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10228760/how-do-i-fix-a-git-detached-head) and [How to Reattach a Detached HEAD](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47154114/how-to-reattach-a-detached-head-in-git).\n  + On undoing merges in git: [Stack Overflow: How Do I Revert All Local Changes?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1146973/how-do-i-revert-all-local-changes-in-git-managed-project-to-previous-state) and [How to Undo a Merge](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42860234/how-to-undo-a-merge-in-github). Here's a [blog post on undoing merges with `git reset`](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/undo-git-merge/).\n  + [GitHub: Reverting a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/reverting-a-pull-request).\n- Learned more about GitHub's personal access tokens:\n  + [GitHub Docs: Managing Your PATs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).\n  + [GitHub Docs: Caching Your GitHub credentials in Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git).\n  + [Stack Overflow: Where to Store My GitHub PAT?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46645843/where-to-store-my-git-personal-access-token).\n- Learned a little more about GitHub Actions:\n  + You can [choose which GitHub Actions to re-run](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs). Nice! When a test fails, I can just rerun that test instead of waiting 45 minutes for everything to run again.\n  + [GitHub Docs: About `GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication).\n  + A [blog post about the `GITHUB_TOKEN` in GitHub Actions](https://dev.to/github/the-githubtoken-in-github-actions-how-it-works-change-permissions-customizations-3cgp).\n  + There's [documentation for `usethis::github_token`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/github-token.html).\n- There's an error that I often get: `In non-interactive environments, please set GITHUB_PAT env to a GitHub access token`. Where does it come from? After doing a GitHub code search, I figured out that it's from the [`gistr` R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gistr/vignettes/gistr.html).\n\n### Created\n\nA mess. I accidentally merged my changes from my fork of `animint2` into the original `animint2` repository. Whoops.\n\n\n## Week 5\n\nThis week (June 26 to July 2), I'm setting the website up again. Yay! Toby said that he [wants me to replace the README entirely](https://github.com/animint/animint2/issues/97#issuecomment-1615428430), so that's happening, too.\n\n### Learned\n\n- You know issue 96? The one about $\\LaTeX$ errors? I [tried installing Inconsolata](https://github.com/animint/animint2/issues/96#issuecomment-1612444392), but it didn't fix the issue. My Inconsolata font is the variable one from [Google Fonts](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/inconsolata).\n- I wanted to know if it was possible to manually run a GitHub Action thing---that way, I would know if I'm failing a test before I submit a pull request. Turns out [the answer is yes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60419257/is-it-possible-to-manually-run-a-github-workflow), but only if I have the `workflow_dispatch` trigger. The workflow in `animint2` doesn't have that trigger, though.\n- Learned that the Windows 11 snipping tool [can record videos](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/learning-center/how-to-record-screen-windows-11).\n- Learned how to [trim videos with ffmpeg](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42827058).\n- I dunno what it does, but there's this [R Universe thing](https://r-universe.dev). You can search for `animint2` and get information about it.\n- Learned that `data()` will generate a list of all of R's [built-in datasets](https://rstats101.com/built-in-datasets-in-r/).\n- Learned that I can [generate GitHub-flavored Markdown (GFM) with Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/gfm.html). Here are [Quarto's options for GFM](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/markdown/gfm.html).\n- R and `ggplot2` have built-in datasets, and I found the codebooks! [These codebooks are for R](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/). And [these are for `ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#data).\n\n### Created\n\n- Toby created an organization, _animint_, for the `animint2` repository. I did some things with it:\n  + I changed the profile picture to a dittered Suki. Improving the world one cat pic at a time.\n  + I changed the settings so that we can control things with our personal access tokens (PATs). If you want, go to `Settings > Third-party Access > Personal Access Tokens` to change it back.\n  + I generated a PAT for `animint2`.\n- Converted `README.md` to `README.qmd`, which will let me do R computations for the website homepage.\n- Added the \"Differences with other packages\" section from `README.org` to the animint2 repo wiki.\n\n### In Progress\n\n- I'm thoroughly updating and cleaning up the `website_setup.Rmd` document.\n- I'm editing `README.qmd` to be clearer and more immediately useful. Later, I'll convert it to `README.md` for `pkgdown` to read.\n\n\n## Week 6\n\nHoping to finish up the website this week (July 3 to July 9). (Editor's note: this didn't happen.) Weird bugs exclusive to me and GitHub-specific problems... I'm behind on my timeline for reasons I didn't anticipate. Good learning experience, though I'm learning about things I didn't anticipated.\n\n### Learned\n\n- Unsurprising, but I learned that you [can't have JavaScript in your GitHub README](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21340803/embed-javascript-in-github-readme-md). This is generally untrue: it's possible to [embed Javascript in Markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2754391/embed-javascript-in-markdown).\n- For Windows, it's easy to [change the localhost default browser](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69508787/how-to-change-the-default-browser-opened-for-localhost).\n- Remember: in RStudio, use <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + C</kbd> to comment out multiple lines.\n- Load a built-in dataset with `data()` and use `View()` to see a dataset more fully.\n- Looked up datasets. Found one about [school shootings](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-school-shootings/tree/master) by the _Washington Post_. Also found the [`worldPop` dataset](https://github.com/Polychart/polychart2/blob/master/example/population.coffee) in `animint2`.\n- Looked up the [CRAN List View on probability distributions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Distributions.html).\n- For subsetting, see [Advanced R: Subsetting Data](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/subsetting.html#subsetting) and [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12328056/how-do-i-delete-rows-in-a-data-frame) on deleting rows.\n- Some useful links for when I'm simulating data:\n  + Use `rep()` to repeat a value some amount of times. [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27472694). [Another link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3672568). [Third link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6432067/create-sequence-of-repeated-values-in-sequence) that suggests other functions.\n  + Use `data.frame(vector1, vector2)` to concatenate vectors into columns. [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14624658).\n\n### Created\n\n- Created `vignettes/simple-examples.Rmd` to house the usage examples for the `README` document. Why? Cuz GitHub doesn't allow JavaScript in its READMEs.\n\n### Other Notes\n\n- When using `animint::labs()`, subtitles, tags, and captions don't work. `ggplot2` page for the function [is here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html).\n\n\n## Week 7\n\nThis week (July 10 to July 16), I've continued work on the quick start guide.\n\n### Learned\n\n- Re-reading [chapter 3](https://rcdata.nau.edu/genomic-ml/animint2-manual/Ch03-showSelected.html) and [chapter 4](https://rcdata.nau.edu/genomic-ml/animint2-manual/Ch04-clickSelects.html) of the _Animint2 Manual_.\n- Cosma Shalizi's [notes on R Markdown](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/). Read this before---it's a useful reference.\n- [R Helpful Codes](https://r.helpful.codes/) has a bunch of little R resources and tutorials. _Advanced R_ [mentions](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/subsetting.html#ordering-integer-subsetting) `order()`.\n- There's a [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/420296/what-are-some-good-books-web-resources-and-projects-for-learning-r) with R Resources, including an [R reference card]() that I've never seen before.\n- Some more useful notes for data simulation:\n  + `sort()` lets us sort our data. `order()` works, too, and in a more sophisticated way.\n  + [`cummax` lets you obtain the largest scalars in your vector](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12600068). It is related to `cumsum()`\n  + Use `rbind() |> c()` to [weave multiple vectors together](https://stackoverflow.com/q/53802352).\n  + It's [pretty easy to sample from multiple vectors and then concatenate them](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46314294).\n- James Murray has a collection of [R tutorials](https://murraylax.org/rtutorials/), including one on the [grammar of graphics](https://murraylax.org/rtutorials/gog.html).\n- Use `[link](#foo-bar)` to link to the `foo-bar` section in a Markdown document. [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16426829).\n\n### Created\n\n- Massaged simulated data until they were useful and looked somewhat real.\n- Continued work with `simple-examples.Rmd`, which was renamed `quick-start.Rmd`. The simple examples vignette has transformed into a larger quick start guide.\n\n\n## Week 8\n\nThis week (July 17 to July 23), I finally finished the quick start guide. And the README, too. I also worked a little on `website_setup.Rmd` and `_pkgdown.yml`.\n\n### Learned\n\n- Erik Bernhardsson has an analysis for why [software projects take longer than expected](https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html). For obvious reasons, it's something I've been thinking about regarding the reference website project.\n- Learned (or re-learned) about the `signif()` function, which is useful for rounding and cutting off overly-precise numbers.\n- _Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction_ has a section on `broom` in Chapter 6. Useful, since it's unclear to me what data tidiers do.\n- There are ways to place plots side by side in `ggplot2`, but those methods don't work in `animint2`. [_ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis_ link](https://ggplot2-book.org/arranging-plots.html). [Stack Overflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/q/1249548).\n- You can remove [legends](https://stackoverflow.com/q/35618260) and [axes](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19821839) in `ggplot2`. These solutions throw up errors when used with `animint2`.\n- In Notepad++:\n  + `Edit > Blank Operations` offers you the option to delete trailing whitespaces.\n  + <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd> throws you into [column mode](https://npp-user-manual.org/docs/editing/). Good for mass editing.\n- Comments are the same in both R and YAML. Use the `#` sign.\n\n### Created\n\n- Finished drafts for `quick-start.Rmd`, `README.qmd`, and `README.md`. Yay!\n\n### In Progress\n\n- Worked on `_pkgdown.yml`.\n\n### Other Notes\n\n- `animint()` fails to render ggplots that uses `geom_smooth()`.\n\n\n## Week 9\n\nThis week (July 24 to July 30), I continued working on `pkgdown.yml`.\n\n### Learned\n\n- The `ggplot2` repository has a [useful `_pkgdown.yml` file](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/main/_pkgdown.yml). I used it as a model for `animint2`'s file.\n- Turns out that there are lots of [whitespace characters in Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Whitespace_character&oldid=1146154369).\n- I got a parser error in my `_pkgdown.yml` file, so I looked it up:\n  + Looked through the [YAML specs](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/). In YAML, it turns out that whitespace is syntactically significant in some places and ignored in others.\n  + This [Stack Overflow response](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21699210) notes there are at least 9 ways to write multi-line strings in YAML and comments: \"YAML is crazy.\"\n- I tried to download the YAML specs as a PDF so it would be easier to read off the computer. This led to a wild adventure:\n  + The YAML repo uses a [Markdown file](https://github.com/yaml/yaml-spec/blob/main/spec/1.2.2/spec.md) that does not play well with pandoc.\n  + I'd forgotten that R Markdown and Quarto create PDFs differently. In the former, use [`output: pdf_document`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html) or the [`render` function](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-9.html). \n  + To [convert multiple images in Imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/mogrify.php), use `magick mogrify`.\n- I'd forgotten why `_pkgdown.yml` uses `bootstrap: 5`. It's cuz some sites might break from the upgrade, so we need to [specify that we wanna use Bootstrap 5](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/blob/c9206802f2888992de92aa41f517ba7812f05331/README.md?plain=1#L68C4-L68C4).\n\n### Created\n\n- Finished the `pkgdown.yml` draft.\n  + There was a parser error, but I fixed it. Turns out it was a [whitespace error](https://github.com/animint/animint2/issues/97#issuecomment-1650780986).\n  + But now there's a [couple of new errors](https://github.com/animint/animint2/issues/97#issuecomment-1650780986). (Editor's note: this was the result of [three misnamed topics](https://github.com/animint/animint2/issues/97#issuecomment-1654634504). They've since been changed.)\n\n\n## Week 10\n\nThis week (July 31 to August 6), I finished `_pkgdown.yml`.\n\n### Learned\n\n- `incomplete final line` warning message is the result of [](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1419)\n- Topics filed under `title: internal` may show up anyway. This is the result of [strangely specific syntax requirements](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2174).\n- Using an SVG workaround, it's possible to use [CSS in a GitHub README](https://css-tricks.com/custom-styles-in-github-readmes/).\n- In Notepad++, you can use the <kbd>CTRL</kbd><kbd>J</kbd> shortcut to [join lines and remove line breaks](https://superuser.com/a/518233).\n- There's an odd warning message when you build or check the site with `pkgdown`: `incomplete final line found on './_pkgdown.yml'`. There's a [bug report about it](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1419). It's a YAML thing, but I'm not sure why.\n  + Just gonna ignore it for now.\n\n### Created\n\n- Finished `pkgdown.yml`! Woot woot!\n  + Reorganized all the topics.\n  + Wrote up descriptions for the titles.\n\n## Week 11\n\nThis week (August 7 to August 13), I put a mostly-finished website online! Woot woot!\n\n### Learned\n\n- Fun with git:\n  + `.gitignore` comments use `#`. Just like R and YAML.\n  + You need to merge all files before you can revert anything.\n  + On GitHub, you can [re-publish a website via the Actions tab](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73733063).\n  + On GitHub, GitHub Pages [automatically deploys a pages-build-deployment workflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/72079903).\n  + You can [manage GitHub credentials](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html) via the usethis package.  \n- Notepad++ stopped working. Removing the plugins folder resolved the issue, though it causes other problems. Probably something wrong with one of the plugins.\n- Reviewed [Max Kohler's advice](https://www.maxkohler.com/posts/everything-i-know-about-alt-text/) about alt text.\n- _Advanced R_ has a chapter called [Debugging](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/debugging.html).\n- Some CSS and HTML links:\n  + You can [select multiple classes](https://css-tricks.com/css-not-with-multiple-classes/) with the `:not()` psuedo-class.\n  + HTML tags can have multiple classes. They're [separated with spaces](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13808874).\n\n### Created\n\n- Did lots of website stuff:\n  + Removed `docs` from the `.gitignore` website.\n  + Finally threw the official animint2 site online. [Here it is](https://animint.github.io/animint2/).\n  + Made minor changes to the alt text.\n  + Fixed an alt text–figure caption duplication error by using `<img src=\"source\" alt=\"alt text\">` instead of `![alt text](source)`.\n  + Moved `world_bank_screencast.gif` to `man/figures`. It's a `pkgdown` [convention](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1472).\n  + Created `pkgdown/extra.css` and wrote some CSS to make changes to the website. It's a `pkgdown` [convention](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/customise.html#additional-html-and-files).\n- Made a PR to begin closing [issue 100](https://github.com/animint/animint2/issues/100).\n  + It's about how some of the datasets lack either a source (2) or a codebook (19). Or both (19).\n  + Added a bunch of TODOs in the `.Rd` files in `man/`.\n  + Added a `todo.md` file briefly explaining the TODO nomenclature.\n\n### Other Notes\n\n- There seems to be a minor accessibility bug with `pkgdown`. When you use `![alt text](source)` and render it as an HTML file, it takes the `alt text` and renders it twice: as the alt text and also as the figure caption.\n\n\n## Week 12\n\nThis week (August 14 to August 20), I worked on improving the website, mostly with CSS.\n\n### Learned\n\n- I was previously unaware of CSS's [letter-spacing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing) property.\n- `pkgdown` can't use Quarto cuz CRAN [doesn't have Quarto installed](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2154). Didn't document this properly till now.\n- Resources that I've looked at to try and solve the JavaScript problem of animints not appearing in the quick guide. I should note that looking into this problem has been somewhat confusing.\n  + Toby told me to look at the [z_knitr.R](https://github.com/animint/animint2/blob/master/R/z_knitr.R) file, just in case it's something on our end.\n  + This [2021 `pkgdown` issue](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1689) mentions something about live graphs no longer working. But that issue has been fixed, hasn't it?\n  + By default, [JavaScript uses the default MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#textjavascript) `text/javascript`.\n  + [How to Include JavaScript files in R Markdown files](https://community.rstudio.com/t/how-to-include-js-file-into-rmarkdown-file/154057/2).\n  + [Hello JS in R Markdown](https://www.aliciaschep.com/blog/js-rmarkdown/).\n  + [How to Add Extra Files to pkgdown Website](https://stackoverflow.com/q/67393709).\n  + Support for custom CSS and JS was added in 2017. [Link](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/317).\n  + [Using RGL in pkgdown Websites](https://dmurdoch.github.io/rgl/articles/pkgdown.html).\n  + Doesn't matter---it fixed itself.\n- Learned and reviewed some CSS stuff:\n  + There's a difference between [child and descendant combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_combinator).\n- The Windows version of `diff` is `fc.exe`. [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6877352).\n- There's an R package called [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/). Seems cool.\n- There were a lot of resources I consulted when designing the code annotations.\n  + Remember: use `element#id` when selecting IDs.\n  + Controlling the gap between the list marker and whatever's after it is a real pain in the rear. See [this CSS Tricks link](https://css-tricks.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gap-after-the-list-marker/) for an analysis of this problem. See [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/q/39747766) or [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4373216) on what to do. I just used `<span>` a bunch of times and then moved those. Thoroughly inelegant, but it works. \n  + [MDN on `<dl>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl).\n  + [MDN on list-style-position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-position), which isn't helpful when you've changed things with `list-style: none`.\n  + [MDN on accessibility concerns re: `list-style: none`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style#accessibility_concerns). Specifically: Safari will stop recognizing the list as a list.\n  + Consulted [MDN on `border`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) when designing the code annotations.\n  + To generating capsule- or stadium-shaped objects, apply a super big `border-radius`. [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18795153). [Second link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71024002).\n  + `::marker` only accepts a limited number of CSS properties. [MDN link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker#allowable_properties). [CSS Tricks link](https://css-tricks.com/list-markers-and-string-styles/).\n  + Because of the limitations above, you need to use workarounds.

I [tested it](https://github.com/animint/animint2/issues/102#issuecomment-1678060496).\n- Finally got the animints working in the quick start guide! I've moved the guide to its own section on the navigation bar.\n- Some other website changes:\n  + Switched the font from system-ui to Roboto Condensed and Roboto Mono.\n  + Changed the link color to match the link color on Toby's website.\n  + Increased spacing between each heading.\n  + Generated code annotations from code comments cuz I don't have direct access to the HTML. This was hard!\n\n### Confused\n\nOkay. Debugging notes. The problem is that the website won't render our animints. This seems to be the result of two issues:\n\n- `pkgdown` renders the animints in the `vignettes/` directory instead of `docs/articles/`.\n- Having the animints in `docs/articles/` doesn't appear to do anything.\n\nMy guess is that it's a `pkgdown` thing. Quarto renders it, so the origin of the problem's not `animint2`. The animint2 Manual renders it, too. So it's not anything to do with R Markdown.\n\nThe JavaScript output looks the same as well. It's a bunch of `<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"animint/directories\">` for the first codeblock, followed by `<script>var chunk_name = new animint(\"#chunk_name\", \"chunk_name/plot.json\");</script>` for any future codeblocks. So there's nothing wrong with the code being generated.\n\nMaybe the code needs to be generated in the `docs/` directory instead of `vignettes/`? But why? I used `fc.exe` to look at the files and obviously there's no difference between them.\n\nOddly, the bug fixed itself. I just renamed the file and now the animints work. Bizarre.\n\n\n## Week 13\n\n[Work product submission week](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/work-product) (August 21 to August 28)! 🐈\n\n## Learned\n\n- Using R and the `magick` package, you can [convert images to waveforms](https://yutani.rbind.io/post/how-to-convert-a-human-to-waves-by-magick-package/). This has nothing to do with animint2. But I just thought it was neat.\n\n## Created\n\nempty\n",
