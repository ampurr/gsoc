## Contributor Biography

Hello! I am currently an unaffiliated researcher, which is a fancy way of saying that I work on papers without getting paid for it. [One's hopefully getting published this year.]{.aside} Formerly, I was a graduate student in psychology, though I also have an undergraduate background in philosophy. 

More relevantly, 

I'm a former graduate student with a background in philosophy and psychology. My specialty is in network psychometrics and substance use disorders. I have a strong interest in computational psychopathology, as well as other computational models in the cognitive sciences.

Like many other scientists, I use R for my research.

Provide a brief (text) biography, and why you think your background qualifies you for this project.

## Contact Information

**Name:** J. Chen

**Postal Address:** `not publicly unavailable`.

**Telephone:** `not publicly unavailable`. Text is preferred, since sometimes my phone won't ring when people call.

**Other Communication Channels:** I'm fine communicating through whatever means my mentors want. I have Slack, Telegram, and Signal, but I have no problem with using another service.



## Contributor Affiliation

I currently have no affiliation. I used to study and work at the New School for Social Research. I was previously an extern clinician at the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center.



## Schedule Conflicts

I'm not applying anywhere else, and I have no other conflicting commitments. I have a weekly ASL class that I attend, which may affect my weekly video call availability, but that's all.
