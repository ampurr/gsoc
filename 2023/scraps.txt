# Scraps

Bits of code and writing that aren't used in the application, but which I'm keeping around for sentimental reasons. And just in case they become useful again.


```{r setup}
#| include: FALSE
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      cache = FALSE,
                      autodep = TRUE)
library(whatever)
```
