# Scraps

Bits of code and writing that aren't used in the application, but which I'm keeping around for sentimental reasons. And just in case they become useful again.

```{r setup}
#| include: FALSE
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      cache = FALSE,
                      autodep = TRUE)
library(whatever)

That's a lot of countries, and most of them have very few responses. Generalizability is affected if _n_ is too small, so I'm going to somewhat arbitrarily keep the ten countries with the largest sample sizes and drop the rest.

```{r}
ten_country <- num_country |> slice(1:10)
ten_country
```
