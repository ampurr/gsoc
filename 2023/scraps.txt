# Scraps

Bits of code that aren't used in the application, but which I'm keeping around for sentimental reasons.


```{r setup}
#| include: FALSE
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      cache = FALSE,
                      autodep = TRUE)
library(whatever)
```

```{r}
b5 <- read_tsv("b5.tsv")
go_away <- c("race", "age", "engnat", "gender", "hand", "source")
b5c <- b5 |> select(-any_of(go_away))
```
